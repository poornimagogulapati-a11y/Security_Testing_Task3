====================================================

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this task is to perform security testing on a sample web application to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

The testing was conducted for educational purposes on a legally permitted demo website.

====================================================

SQL INJECTION TEST

Description:
SQL Injection is a vulnerability where attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate database queries and gain unauthorized access.

Test Input Used:
Username: ' OR '1'='1
Password: ' OR '1'='1

Procedure:
The SQL injection payload was entered in the login form to check whether authentication could be bypassed.

Result:
The application did not allow login bypass.
An invalid login message was displayed.

Status:
NOT VULNERABLE (Protected against basic SQL Injection)

Risk (If Vulnerable):
Unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Mitigation:

Use Prepared Statements

Implement Parameterized Queries

Perform Proper Input Validation

Use Stored Procedures

Apply Least Privilege Principle

====================================================

CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) TEST

Description:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

Test Input Used:

<script>alert('XSS')</script>

Procedure:
The script payload was entered in the search/input field to check if the application executes user-supplied JavaScript.

Result:
The JavaScript alert popup was successfully executed.
This confirms that user input was not properly sanitized.

Status:
VULNERABLE

Risk:
Attackers can execute malicious scripts, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or data manipulation.

Mitigation:

Implement Input Sanitization

Use Output Encoding

Apply Content Security Policy (CSP)

Validate and Filter User Inputs

====================================================

ACCOUNT ACCESS TESTING

Description:
Account summary and transaction history were accessed after successful login.

Valid Credentials Used:
Username: jsmith
Password: demo1234

Direct URL access without authentication was also tested.

Result:
The application allowed access after valid login.
When trying to access account pages directly without login,
the system redirected to the login page.

Status:
SECURE ACCESS CONTROL IMPLEMENTED

====================================================

OVERALL CONCLUSION

The application is protected against basic SQL Injection attacks but is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Proper secure coding practices, strong input validation, and output encoding mechanisms should be implemented to improve security.

This testing was conducted strictly for educational purposes on a legally permitted demo application
